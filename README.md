## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. 
56.67% of the 5-star Amazon reviews were paid Vine reviews, similarly 56.70% of the 5-star reviews were unpaid reviews. This does not seem to describe positivity bias in the Vine program, at least not for the musical instruments dataset that I used. We could look at the statistical mean, mode, and median of the data for both vine progam reviews and unpaid reviews.
